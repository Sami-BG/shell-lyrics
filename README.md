# spotify-lyrics
A text-based app that automatically searches for and displays the lyrics of the Spotify track you're currently listening to.

Running the executable will open a new tab in your webbrowser that will prompt you to log in to Spotify. Once logged, in you
will be redirected to a webpage, and you will then be asked to paste the URL of that page onto the command line.

Once that's done, the program should begin displaying the lyrics of the track you're currently playing on your Spotify account,
provided it can find the lyrics on the Genius database.

Might not work as intended if there is another song with the same name.
